# PAAPIWeather
Implemented TestNG Data driven framework to validate the API weather test by providing City and Date value.
Please follow the steps for execution
Step 1: Please copy the source code/files from master branch and store them in the local eclipse project
Step 2: Created excel data file(Data.xls) in the Project, here we can update the City and date details whatever we need to validate in the sheet(Please go through the attached Data.xls file in the project)
Step 3: Created testng.xml to run the test. Right click the testng.xml from the Project and select Run As --> TestNG suite.
Step 4: After the completion of execution the results will be generated in test-output folder(Navigate to test-output-->APIWeatherSuite-->APIWeatherTest.html). Here we can verify the executed results and reports.
Step 5: Created WeatherDetails folder in the Project where all the weather details will be logged during runtime for the City and Date. The created file will be in the format(Ex:-London-2021-04-21.txt)

Please follow the same folder structer as structure in master branch
